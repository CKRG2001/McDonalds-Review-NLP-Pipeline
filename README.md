# 🍔 McDonald's Review NLP Pipeline

An end-to-end NLP pipeline that processes 33,000+ McDonald's customer reviews — cleaning, classifying sentiment, labeling negative reviews by issue type, and visualizing insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project takes raw McDonald's customer reviews and runs them through a full NLP pipeline:

1. **Data Cleaning** — removes encoding corruption, normalizes whitespace, parses store addresses
2. **Sentiment Classification** — classifies each review as `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` using DistilBERT
3. **Issue Labeling** — labels negative reviews by complaint category using Zero Shot Classification
4. **Interactive Dashboard** — visualizes insights through a Streamlit web app

## 🧠 Models Used

| Task | Model | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Sentiment Analysis | `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` | Fine-tuned DistilBERT |
| Issue Labeling | `facebook/bart-large-mnli` | Zero Shot Classification |

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

| Chart | Description |
|---|---|
| Sentiment Distribution | Overall breakdown of positive, negative, neutral |
| Top 10 States by Sentiment % | Stacked % bar chart per state |
| Issue Breakdown | Most common complaint categories in negative reviews |
| Top 10 Cities | Cities with most negative reviews |

**Sidebar filters:**
- Filter by State — all charts update dynamically
- KPI metrics — total reviews, negative count, positive count, avg rating

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **49%** of reviews are negative — significant dissatisfaction across locations
- **Wrong or missing orders** is the #1 complaint category
- **FL, TX, CA, NY** have the highest review volume
- **Dirty or unhygienic** conditions are the 2nd most common complaint
